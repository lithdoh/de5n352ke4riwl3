**Don't worry about the repo name**

Cycle Selector is a website I'm working on to help people determine bike part compatibility.
It makes use of reactive principals on things like the sort headers, paginator, filters, search input, receiving data from backend, etc.

Features server-side sorting and filtering:

Server-side pagination:

Uses Dgraph database to model the compatibility relationships between part types, e.g. [frame, fork], [chain, cassette], [rear derailleur, crankset].

Instead of sifting through compatibility guides and tables like these:

https://www.ceramicspeed.com/media/3napv0hg/webposter_bbmatrix2021_web.pdf

https://productinfo.shimano.com/#/com

users can select parts and see whether they are compatible or not. I think it would be cool if the rule(s) that determines the compatibility of parts is/are made available. This would a great help in an educational sense, but it would also allow users to verify that the verdict is sensible. Because it will be difficult to get every last rule pinned down, I think it would be good to have a way for people to verify rules and submit update suggestions. Compatibility is not always straightforward. For example, if you have a chain and rear derailleur that are the same speed, they still might not be compatible because it's a flattop chain and the rear derailleur is SRAM Eagle and hence is not compatible because of the RD pulley. 

**Compatible but not recommended**

Two parts might be technically compatible, but there may be drawbacks to using them. If you use a Shimano cassette and a SRAM chain, you're shifting might be suboptimal compared to using the same brands for both parts. Similarly, you _can_ use a 2.8" tire on a 28mm rim, but the tire shape becomes too tall and round, which can result in reduced cornering performance and tire squirm.

I'd like to keep a database of completed builds that companies have sold, for three reasons:
1. Users can enter their Brand, Model, and Year instead of manually entering their bikeâ€™s components.
2. If a user builds a bike that is already being sold as a complete, show them the complete because it will probably be cheaper than the sum of the part costs, not to mention labor for the build.
3. Knowing that a combination of parts has been used by a brand in a complete bike is confidence-boosting.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
